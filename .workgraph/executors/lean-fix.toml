## RECURRENT SORRY-FIXING LOOP

This is part of an iterative process to remove all `sorry` placeholders from Lean proofs.

### Your Job

1. Read the relevant Lean file
2. Find all `sorry` statements
3. For each sorry, write a real proof using Mathlib tactics
4. Save the file
5. Run `lake build` to verify compilation
6. CRITICAL: Run `wg done {{task_id}}` when finished

### Key Lean Tactics
- simp, ring, omega, linarith for algebraic goals
- exact, apply, have, obtain for building proofs
- norm_num for numerical bounds
- Real.tanh_lt_one, Real.abs_tanh_lt_one from Mathlib

### Important
- Write REAL proofs, not mock implementations
- If a sorry is genuinely hard, leave a detailed comment but still try
- ALWAYS run `wg done {{task_id}}` at the end
