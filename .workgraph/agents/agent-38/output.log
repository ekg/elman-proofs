I have completed the task **2-3-prove: Prove all continuity-related sorries**. Here's what was accomplished:

## Summary

### What was found:
1. The main continuity theorems (`linear_rnn_continuous_per_t` and `linear_rnn_continuous_output` in `ExactCounting.lean`) were **already proven** with no sorries.

2. The theorem `exact_count_detection_not_linear` (line 413) was using a sorry for a **discontinuity argument** that relies on continuity principles.

### What was proven:
I added a new theorem `exact_count_detection_discontinuous` and proved `exact_count_detection_not_linear` using the same IVT/connectedness pattern used in the already-proven `running_threshold_discontinuous` theorem.

**Key proof technique:**
- The `exactCountDetection` function only outputs values in {0, 1}
- All-zeros input gives output 0 (count = 0 ≠ k when k > 0)
- k-ones input gives output 1 
- If a linear RNN could compute this, the output would be continuous
- But a continuous function on a connected domain mapping to {0,1} and hitting both values must hit 0.5 (by IVT/ordConnected)
- Contradiction since exactCountDetection never outputs 0.5
