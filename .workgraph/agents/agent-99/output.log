Task completed. I've updated section 4 (`docs/expressivity/04-e88.typ`) to properly emphasize **matrix state as E88's core innovation**. Key changes:

## Summary of Updates

### 1. New Overview (4.1)
- Changed subtitle from "Tanh Saturation, Latching, and Expressivity Separation" to "Matrix State, Tanh Saturation, and Expressivity Separation"
- Added "The central insight": E88 maintains a **matrix** $S \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, providing $O(d^2)$ information capacity vs $O(d)$ for Mamba2
- Restructured central results to emphasize matrix state first

### 2. New Section 4.2: "Matrix State as Core Innovation"
- Added **Definition: Matrix State vs Vector State** with explicit capacity comparison (64 values vs 4,096 for d=64)
- Added **Theorem: Matrix State Capacity** comparing E88 ($Hd^2$) to Mamba2 ($n$)
- Added explanation of outer product $vk^T$ as associative storage

### 3. New Section 4.2.1: Comparison Table
- Added explicit table comparing E88 matrix state vs Mamba2 vector state
- Highlighted capacity difference (128× for typical configurations)

### 4. New Section 4.3: "How Tanh Preserves Matrix State"
- Explained dual purpose: bounding and saturation for preservation

### 5. New Section 4.8.1: "Why Matrix State Enables Multi-Fact Tracking"
- Added definition of multi-fact tracking
- Concrete example: tracking "who spoke to whom" requires $d^2$ matrix
- Theorem on vector state limitation

### 6. Updated Summary Table (4.11)
- Added **State type** row (Matrix vs Vector)
- Added **State capacity** row ($d^2$ vs $n$)  
- Added **Multi-fact tracking** row
- Updated caption to emphasize state capacity as fundamental distinction

### 7. Rewritten Conclusion (4.12)
- Now explicitly states **two** innovations: matrix state + temporal nonlinearity
- Explains why Mamba2's depth cannot compensate for state capacity limits
- Added MatrixStateRNN.lean to file references
