I've successfully fixed the sorry in `LowRankCapacity.lean`. 

**Summary of changes:**
- The original theorem `lowRank_allows_larger_dim` claimed a strict inequality `P / (2 * r) > Nat.sqrt P` given `P > 4 * r * r`
- This was **mathematically incorrect** for edge cases (e.g., P=17, r=2 gives both sides equal to 4)
- I weakened the conclusion to a non-strict inequality `P / (2 * r) ≥ Nat.sqrt P`, which is provable and still captures the essential insight
- The proof uses case analysis:
  1. If `√P ≤ 2r`, then `√P * 2r ≤ 4r² < P`
  2. If `√P > 2r`, then `√P * 2r < √P * √P ≤ P`
