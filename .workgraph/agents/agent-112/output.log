The narrative arc and coherence pass is complete. Here's a summary of the transformation:

## Summary of Changes

**Overall Narrative Arc:**
- Document now tells a coherent story: question → investigation → discovery → resolution
- Central question ("Where should nonlinearity live?") established in introduction and resolved in conclusion
- Each section flows naturally into the next with explicit transitions

**Section-by-Section:**

1. **Introduction** - Rewrote to hook with the central question, then preview the journey
2. **Foundations** - Transformed from reference material into building blocks for the investigation
3. **Linear Limitation** - Now presents the impossibility results as rising tension ("what can't be done")
4. **E88** - The turn—shows how tanh saturation escapes the barriers
5. **E23 vs E88** - Two escape routes, different trade-offs
6. **Separation** - The hierarchy emerges as a discovery
7. **Implications** - Practical consequences flow from theory
8. **TC⁰ Bounds** - Classical complexity perspective deepens the story ("the inverted hierarchy")
9. **Output Feedback** - The emergent tape insight explains why chain-of-thought works
10. **Multi-Pass RNN** - A middle path between fixed state and full feedback
11. **Experimental Results** - The twist—practice inverts theory, but we explain why
12. **Formal Verification** - Brief, emphasizes certainty
14. **Composition Depth** - When does the theory matter?
16. **Appendix** - Reference tables

**New Elements:**
- Complete **abstract** that previews the narrative journey
- Full **conclusion** that resolves the central question and synthesizes all findings
- Removed empty/merged sections (13, 15) from includes
- Updated references section

**Removed Anti-patterns:**
- Bullet point lists replaced with flowing prose
- "Here are 5 facts" structures woven into narrative
- Theorems now feel like discoveries in the story
- Explicit connections between sections ("The next section..." transitions)
