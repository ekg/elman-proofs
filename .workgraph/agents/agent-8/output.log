The task is complete. Let me provide a summary of what was formalized:

## Summary: Multi-Head Temporal Independence (E88)

I created `/home/erikg/elman-proofs/ElmanProofs/Expressivity/MultiHeadTemporalIndependence.lean` which formalizes E88 heads as parallel state machines.

### Key Results Proven

1. **Head Independence** (`e88_head_update_independent`)
   - Each head's state update depends ONLY on its own state and the input
   - Other heads' states have zero influence on a head's dynamics

2. **No Cross-Head Interaction** (`e88_heads_do_not_interact`)
   - Modifying head h₂'s state does not affect head h₁'s update

3. **Parallel State Machine Semantics** (`e88HeadAsStateMachine`, `e88AsParallelStateMachines`)
   - Each head is formally a state machine with transition function δ = tanh-based update
   - H heads form H independent state machines running in parallel

4. **State Equivalence** (`e88_state_equals_parallel_machines`)
   - The E88 recurrence exactly matches the state machine definition

5. **Trajectory Independence** (`e88_head_trajectory_independent`)
   - Different heads have completely independent state trajectories

6. **Capacity Scaling** (`e88_head_capacity_additive`, `e88_multihead_binary_latch_capacity`)
   - Total state capacity = H × d² (H heads, d×d matrices each)
   - H heads can latch at least H independent binary facts

7. **Output Linearity** (`e88_output_linear_in_heads`)
   - The final output is a linear combination of head outputs (additive + homogeneous)

8. **FSM Simulation** (`e88_head_simulates_fsm` - existence stated, encoding `sorry`)
   - Each head can simulate a finite state machine with n ≤ d² states

### Key Insight

**"E88 heads are parallel state machines."** Unlike attention (O(n²) interactions), E88 has:
- O(H) independent recurrences during temporal processing
- O(1) cross-head interaction only at output projection

This provides H-fold parallelism for tracking H independent temporal patterns, counting states, or binary latches.
