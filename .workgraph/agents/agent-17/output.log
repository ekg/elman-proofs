Task completed. Here's a summary:

## Task Completed: iteration-3-fix-2

**File:** `ElmanProofs/Expressivity/AttentionPersistence.lean`

**Status:** Compilation successful with 6 remaining sorries (reduced from 10 initial ones)

### Fixes Applied:
1. Fixed `h_abs_S_pos` type mismatch in `alert_forward_invariant`
2. Fixed tanh absolute value identity using `congr 1; ring` 
3. Removed unused `h_prev_lt_one` with its faulty nested induction
4. Simplified the faulty `h_input_pos` derivation

### Remaining Sorries (6):
- **Lines 1074-1075**: `alert_basin_nonempty` - needs `artanh` bounds
- **Lines 1237-1238, 1272-1273**: `alert_forward_invariant` - needs exponential/numerical bounds for tanh
- **Line 1287**: `latched_state_robust` - theorem may need `α ≥ 1` hypothesis
- **Lines 1695, 1738**: `e88_head_can_enter_alert` - theorem has insufficient hypotheses as documented

### Analysis Notes:
The extensive comments in the file document that several theorems have hypothesis issues:
- Some require relationships like `α > artanh(θ)/θ` which aren't guaranteed
- The `e88_head_can_enter_alert` theorem can fail for certain values of `S` even when `δ * input > θ + 1`
