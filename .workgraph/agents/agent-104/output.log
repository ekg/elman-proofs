Task completed. I restyled sections 7 and 8 of the expressivity document:

**Section 7 (Practical Implications):**
- Added `#import "traditional-math-style.typ": *`
- Removed all colored boxes (`fill:`, `stroke:`, `radius:`)
- Converted content to proper theorem/definition/proposition environments
- Consolidated 3 tables down to 1 simple table
- Added narrative flow with connecting prose
- Used `#keyinsight`, `#mediumrule`, `#heavyrule` for visual structure

**Section 8 (TC⁰ Bounds):**
- Added traditional math style import
- Presented the hierarchy reversal clearly: Linear SSM < TC⁰ < E88
- Removed redundant tables (had 4 tables, now has 1 key summary table)
- Used proper theorem/proof environments for all major results
- Added clear proof sketches for the complexity bounds
- Emphasized the key insight that the naive "Transformer > SSM > RNN" ordering reverses for computational expressivity
