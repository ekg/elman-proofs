Task completed. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary: Section 09 - Output Feedback and Emergent Tape

**Deliverable created:** `docs/expressivity/09-output-feedback.typ`

**Key content:**
1. **Transformer CoT as random-access tape** - Attention provides O(1) access to any position in the "tape" of previously generated tokens
2. **RNN feedback as sequential tape** - Feedback creates O(T) memory but with sequential access (O(T) to reach any position)
3. **Scratchpad/working memory formalization** - Explicit model of write-and-read computation  
4. **E88+feedback vs fixed E88 separation** - Palindrome recognition as the witness problem (O(1) vs O(T) memory)
5. **CoT equivalence to explicit tape** - Chain-of-thought is computationally equivalent to bounded tape memory

**Complete hierarchy:**
```
Fixed Mamba2 < Fixed E88 < E88+Feedback ≈ Transformer+CoT < E23
```

**Files modified:**
- Created `docs/expressivity/09-output-feedback.typ` 
- Updated `docs/expressivity/main.typ` to include Section 09 and add OutputFeedback.lean reference

**References:** All theorems reference `ElmanProofs/Expressivity/OutputFeedback.lean` which contains the formal Lean proofs.
