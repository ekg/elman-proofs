The cross-section consistency pass is complete. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## Summary of Cross-Section Consistency Fixes

### 1. Style Template Unification
- **Sections 13-16** were using locally-defined macros with colored boxes (rgb fills and strokes)
- Updated all four sections to import and use `traditional-math-style.typ`
- Added missing macros (`observation`, `finding`, `failure`) to the shared style file in traditional math style

### 2. Section Numbering Normalization
- **Sections 13-16** used manual numbering like "== 13.1 The Central Paradox"
- **Sections 1-12** used descriptive headings like "== The Central Result"
- Removed all manual numbering from sections 13-15 to match the style of sections 1-12
- Section 16 retains "A.1", "A.2" style as appropriate for an appendix

### 3. Mathematical Symbol Consistency
- Standardized `subset.eq.not` → `subset.neq` across all files for consistency
- Both are valid Typst but `subset.neq` is more conventional

### 4. Colored Block Elimination
- Replaced all `#block(fill: rgb(...), stroke: rgb(...))` constructs with `#keyinsight[...]` from the shared style template
- This maintains visual consistency with the traditional mathematical style

### 5. Document Compilation
- Verified the document compiles successfully with `typst compile`

The document now has consistent:
- Theorem/definition/lemma styling (traditional math style without colored boxes)
- Section heading format (descriptive titles without manual numbers)
- Mathematical notation (standardized set operators)
- Cross-references between sections
