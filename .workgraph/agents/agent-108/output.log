The task is complete. I have restyled sections 13-16 of the expressivity document:

**Section 13 (Theory-Practice Gap)**: Converted from colored boxes to flowing prose with key insights. Removed `#finding` and `#observation` blocks, using `#definition`, `#proposition`, `#simpletable`, `#remark`, and `#keyinsight` from the traditional math style.

**Section 14 (Composition Depth in Human Text)**: Restructured with narrative flow, converting examples to proper `#example` environments and tables to `#simpletable`. Added transitions between sections.

**Section 15 (Uncanny Valley of Reasoning)**: Removed colored box definitions for failure modes and converted to prose. Used `#definition`, `#theorem`, `#proposition`, `#example`, and `#simpletable` environments. Focused on flowing narrative explaining why LLMs fail at deep reasoning.

**Section 16 (Composition Depth Examples)**: Cleaned up the appendix reference tables using `#simpletable` throughout. Added proper `#definition` blocks for key concepts (composition depth calculation, running parity, running threshold). Converted final summary box to `#keyinsight`.

All sections:
- Import `traditional-math-style.typ`
- Use proper environments from the style file
- Have no old-style `#finding` or `#observation` blocks
- Follow the narrative philosophy from the style guide
- Compile successfully with typst
