I've completed the task. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Section 10: Multi-Pass RNN Model** has been written and added to the expressivity document.

The section covers all the required content:

1. **k passes = O(k) soft random access**: Formalized how k-pass RNNs can access any position with cost O(k) passes using a 3-phase approach (mark, locate, retrieve)

2. **Tape modification between passes**: Defined inter-pass tape operations including read, transform, and virtual insert/delete

3. **E88 multi-pass computational class**: Introduced MULTIPASS(k, T) and E88-MULTIPASS(k) computational classes, positioned in the hierarchy between single-pass E88 and full feedback models

4. **Comparison: Transformer O(T) parallel vs RNN k-pass O(kT) sequential**: Detailed table comparing access patterns, time complexity, and parallelism with task-specific efficiency analysis

5. **Practical tradeoffs**: Hardware efficiency metrics showing when to prefer Transformers (many random accesses, high parallelism) vs k-Pass RNNs (few random accesses, memory-limited hardware)
