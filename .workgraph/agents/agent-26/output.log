**Summary:** The NumericalBounds.lean file is already complete with no `sorry` statements. It contains proven numerical bounds for exp and tanh functions:

- `exp_2_gt_7`, `exp_3_gt_20`, `exp_4_gt_54` 
- `tanh_1_gt_076`, `tanh_15_gt_090`, `tanh_2_gt_096`
- `tanh_strictMono` and derived bounds

The file compiles successfully. Task marked as done.
