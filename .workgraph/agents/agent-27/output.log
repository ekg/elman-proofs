## Summary

I completed the root cause analysis of the 21 remaining sorries in the ElmanProofs/Expressivity directory. Here are the key findings:

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Incorrect Theorem Statements (~10 sorries)** - The PRIMARY issue
   - Several theorems are **mathematically false** as stated
   - Missing `α > 1` hypothesis in `alert_basin_nonempty` 
   - Missing `θ < S*(α)` constraint in forward invariance theorems
   - Example: For α=1.01 and θ=0.9, the fixed point S*≈0.1 < θ, making the theorem false

2. **Missing Numerical Bounds (~2 sorries)**
   - Need `tanh(0.575) > 0.5` and similar
   - Provable via exp definition: tanh(x) = (exp(2x)-1)/(exp(2x)+1)

3. **Existence Proofs Needing Constructions (~9 sorries)**
   - Continuity lemmas need Mathlib's matrix continuity API
   - E88 counting proofs need explicit parameter constructions
   - Fixed point proofs need IVT arguments

### Updated Documentation

I updated `docs/SORRY_INVENTORY.md` with:
- Current sorry count (21, down from original 57)
- Detailed line-by-line analysis
- Root cause categorization
- Recommended fix strategy prioritized by impact
