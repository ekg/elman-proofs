The task is complete. I've restyled sections 9 and 10 of the expressivity document with traditional mathematical style:

**Section 9 (Output Feedback) changes:**
- Removed all colored boxes with rounded corners
- Added proper `#import "traditional-math-style.typ": *`
- Stated the **Emergent Tape Theorem** clearly with a full proof explaining why output feedback creates $O(T)$ memory
- Used traditional theorem/definition/proof environments
- Added narrative connection to Section 8 (circuit complexity)
- Used `#centerrule`, `#mediumrule`, `#keyinsight`, and `#simpletable` for visual structure
- Added `#leanfile` footnote references

**Section 10 (Multi-Pass RNN) changes:**
- Removed colored box definitions at the top
- Applied traditional math styling throughout
- Clearly stated the k-Pass Random Access theorem with proof
- Used proper theorem/definition/corollary/proposition/remark environments
- Fixed Typst syntax (`lfloor`/`rfloor` → `floor()`)
- Added narrative flow connecting to Section 9 and forward to later sections
- Included the Complete Hierarchy theorem with proof

Both sections now compile successfully and follow the style guide principles: narrative prose, traditional math formatting, lean references as footnotes, and no colored boxes.
