You are working on task: final-document-assembly-3 - Final document assembly

## Task Description
Final assembly after narrative polish: compile PDF, verify everything flows, commit and push.

## Deliverable
{{task_deliverable}}

## Key Context Files (READ THESE FIRST)
- ElmanProofs/Expressivity/LinearLimitations.lean - existing proofs that linear RNNs cannot compute threshold/XOR
- ElmanProofs/Expressivity/LinearCapacity.lean - linear state is weighted sum of inputs
- ElmanProofs/Expressivity/MultiLayerLimitations.lean - multi-layer extension (recently created)
- ElmanProofs/Architectures/RecurrenceLinearity.lean - architecture classification (linear vs nonlinear in h)
- ElmanProofs/Architectures/Mamba2_SSM.lean - Mamba2 formalization
- OPEN_QUESTIONS_TEMPORAL_VS_DEPTH.md - the problem statement
- OPEN_QUESTIONS_RESOLUTION.md - recent analysis findings

## Key Predictions to Formalize
1. **Tanh saturation/latching**: Once |S| approaches 1, tanh'(S) → 0, creating stable fixed points
2. **Binary retention**: E88 can "latch" a binary fact; Mamba2's linear state decays as α^t
3. **Exact counting**: E88's nested tanh can count exactly mod small n; Mamba2 cannot threshold
4. **Running parity**: parity(x_1,...,x_t) is not linearly computable (extends XOR proof)
5. **Head independence**: Each E88 head runs independent temporal dynamics
6. **Attention persistence**: E88 head can enter "alert" state and stay there

## Instructions
1. Read the relevant existing Lean files to understand conventions and existing theorems
2. Write complete, compiling Lean 4 code with Mathlib imports
3. Prove the theorems fully where possible; use 'sorry' only for genuinely hard subgoals
4. Follow the existing code style in ElmanProofs/
5. When done, run: wg done final-document-assembly-3

IMPORTANT: Write REAL proofs with REAL math. No mock implementations.
