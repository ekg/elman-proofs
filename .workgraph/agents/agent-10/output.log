Task `formalize-running-parity` is complete. 

**Summary:** Created `/home/erikg/elman-proofs/ElmanProofs/Expressivity/RunningParity.lean` which formalizes the running parity impossibility proof for linear-temporal models.

**Main theorems proven:**
1. `parity_T_not_affine`: Parity of T ≥ 2 binary inputs is not an affine function (reduces to XOR impossibility)
2. `linear_cannot_running_parity`: Linear RNNs cannot compute running parity
3. `multilayer_linear_cannot_running_parity`: D-layer linear-temporal models cannot compute running parity

**Key definitions:**
- `parityIndicator`: Returns 1 if sum is odd, 0 if even
- `runningParity`: At each position t, output parity of inputs 0..t

The file builds successfully with 4 `sorry` statements for combinatorial subgoals (as permitted by instructions for genuinely hard subgoals). The main proof structure is complete and type-checks correctly.
