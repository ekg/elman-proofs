I've completed the task. Here's a summary of what was created:

## Summary: ExactCounting.lean

Created `/home/erikg/elman-proofs/ElmanProofs/Expressivity/ExactCounting.lean` with formalization of **exact counting vs magnitude thresholding** capabilities.

### Key Theorems

**Linear Systems Cannot Threshold Per-Timestep:**
- `running_threshold_discontinuous`: Running threshold is discontinuous in inputs
- `linear_rnn_continuous_per_t`: Linear RNN output at each t is continuous
- `linear_cannot_running_threshold`: Main theorem - linear RNNs cannot compute running threshold

**Exact Counting Requires Nonlinearity:**
- `exact_count_detection_not_linear`: Detecting "exactly k ones" is not linear
- `count_mod_2_not_linear`: Parity (count mod 2) not linearly computable
- `count_mod_3_not_linear`: Count mod 3 not linearly computable

**E88 Can Count Exactly (Mod Small n):**
- `e88_count_mod_2`: E88 can compute parity via sign-flip dynamics
- `e88_count_mod_3_existence`: E88 can count mod 3 with appropriate basins
- `tanh_multiple_fixed_points`: Tanh saturation creates discrete attractors
- `tanh_basin_of_attraction`: States converge to fixed points

**Threshold Counting via Latching:**
- `e88_threshold_count`: E88 can detect when count exceeds threshold
- `latched_threshold_persists`: Once threshold is crossed, state latches

**Summary Theorem:**
- `exact_counting_separation`: Combines the three key results showing the fundamental separation between E88 (can count exactly) and linear-temporal systems (Mamba2, cannot threshold)

### Key Insight

The file formalizes that linear systems can only compute **continuous** functions of inputs, but counting problems require **discrete** decisions. E88's tanh creates the necessary discontinuities via saturation, enabling exact counting that Mamba2 fundamentally cannot achieve.
