I've completed the task. Here's a summary of what was created:

## Summary

Created **`docs/expressivity/12-formal-system.typ`** - a comprehensive section describing the Lean 4 formal verification system for the expressivity document.

### Content Overview:

1. **Why Formal Verification Matters** - Contrasts machine-checked proofs vs. typical ML paper arguments, explaining what "mathematical certainty" means

2. **Repository Structure** - Table showing the organization of `ElmanProofs/`:
   - `Expressivity/` - core theorems
   - `Architectures/` - E1, E88, Mamba2 formalizations
   - `Activations/`, `Dynamics/`, etc.

3. **Key Proof Files** - Detailed descriptions of:
   - `LinearCapacity.lean` - state is weighted sum of inputs
   - `LinearLimitations.lean` - linear cannot compute threshold/XOR
   - `MultiLayerLimitations.lean` - depth doesn't compensate
   - `RunningParity.lean` - parity impossibility
   - `TanhSaturation.lean` - saturation dynamics
   - `BinaryFactRetention.lean` - latching vs decay
   - `RecurrenceLinearity.lean` - architecture classification

4. **Proof Verification Status** - Table showing core expressivity proofs are fully verified (no sorries)

5. **How to Read the Lean Code** - Brief guide for non-Lean users (syntax, common patterns, type annotations)

6. **Building and Verifying** - Instructions for cloning and building the proofs

7. **What Formal Verification Guarantees** - Clear statement of what machine-checked proofs provide (and don't provide)

The section emphasizes that this is the "gold standard" - mathematical certainty, not sketch-level arguments - and references `github.com/ekg/elman-proofs` throughout.
