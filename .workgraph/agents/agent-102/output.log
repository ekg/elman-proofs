Task completed. I've restyled sections 3 and 4 of the expressivity document:

**03-linear-limitation.typ:**
- Imported traditional-math-style.typ
- Removed colored boxes, using traditional theorem/definition/proof formatting
- Streamlined content from ~140 lines to ~110 lines
- Added narrative flow connecting to previous/next sections
- Used `#keyinsight` for the central message about composition depth
- Added Lean footnote references

**04-e88.typ:**
- Imported traditional-math-style.typ
- Removed local colored-box definitions (was ~590 lines, now ~210 lines)
- Consolidated redundant theorems (e.g., merged multiple fixed point theorems into one "Bifurcation" theorem)
- Emphasized the matrix state insight prominently at the start
- Kept the key comparison tables using `#simpletable`
- Used `#keyinsight` blocks for central messages
- Improved prose narrative connecting theory to mechanism
- Added Lean footnote references throughout

The document compiles cleanly with `typst compile main.typ`.
