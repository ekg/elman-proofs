I've completed the task. Here's a summary of what was fixed:

## Summary: Fixed 2 sorries in E23_DualMemory.lean

### 1. `softmax_nonneg` (line 126-132)
**Theorem**: Softmax outputs are non-negative: `softmax scores i ≥ 0`

**Proof strategy**: Since `softmax scores i = exp(scores i) / Σ exp(scores j)`, and both numerator and denominator are positive (exp is always positive), the result is non-negative. Used `div_nonneg` with `Real.exp_pos` and `Finset.sum_nonneg`.

### 2. `hard_attention_is_tm_write` (line 742-762)
**Theorem**: With hard (one-hot) attention, replacement write becomes exact slot replacement - matching TM write semantics.

**Proof strategy**: Split on whether `slot = target_slot`:
- If equal: `one_hot slot = 1`, so `(1-1)*old + 1*new = new`
- If not equal: `one_hot slot = 0`, so `(1-0)*old + 0*new = old`

Used `split_ifs`, `if_pos`/`if_neg`, and `ring` for the arithmetic.
