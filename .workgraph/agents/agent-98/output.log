I have completed the task. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary

I wrote all four discussion and depth analysis sections for the expressivity document:

### Section 13: Theory-Practice Gap (`13-theory-practice-gap.typ`)
- Analyzes why theoretically more expressive architectures (E88) can lose to less expressive ones (Mamba2) in practice
- Distinguishes between **sample efficiency** (learning per example) and **wall-clock efficiency** (throughput)
- Explains that Mamba2's ~4x throughput advantage often outweighs E88's expressivity advantage
- Covers when theory predicts practice: tasks requiring temporal nonlinearity + sufficient training budget

### Section 14: Composition Depth in Human Text (`14-composition-depth-text.typ`)
- Analyzes how much composition depth natural language actually requires
- Covers syntactic depth (2-7 levels), semantic depth (3-4 levels), and discourse depth (4-6 levels)
- Compares with code execution which can require much higher depth (50-1000+)
- Includes detailed examples: pronoun resolution, arithmetic word problems, logical deduction, code execution traces

### Section 15: Uncanny Valley of Reasoning (`15-uncanny-valley-reasoning.typ`)
- Explains why LLMs appear to reason but fail on tasks requiring deep thought
- Documents failure modes: state tracking failures, logical deduction failures, mathematical reasoning failures
- Distinguishes pattern recognition (what LLMs do well) from computation (what reasoning requires)
- Analyzes chain-of-thought as a workaround and its limitations
- Discusses architectural paths forward: E88-style temporal nonlinearity, multi-pass processing, hybrid architectures, external tools

### Section 16: Depth Examples Appendix (`16-depth-examples.typ`)
- Comprehensive reference tables for composition depth requirements
- Covers: natural language, arithmetic, logical reasoning, algorithm execution, code understanding, state machines, running parity, and threshold counting
- Provides an architecture selection guide based on depth requirements

All sections were added to `main.typ` and the PDF was successfully compiled (2.3MB).
