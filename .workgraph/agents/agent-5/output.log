Task complete. I've consolidated all findings into `OPEN_QUESTIONS_RESOLUTION.md` which resolves the three open questions:

**Q1 (Depth compensation):** NO — D-layer Mamba2 has composition depth D, while D-layer E88 has depth D×T. The gap is a factor of sequence length T.

**Q2 (Separation example):** YES — Running threshold count and temporal XOR chain are computable by 1-layer E88 but not by any D-layer Mamba2 for sufficiently long sequences (T > 2^D).

**Q3 (Practical implications):** NUANCED — The theoretical separation is real and provable, but for D≥32 and typical language sequences, depth may compensate in practice. The gap would manifest most clearly in algorithmic reasoning tasks requiring temporal decision sequences.

The resolution document references all the analysis files (Q1, Q2, Q3 analyses), the Lean proofs in `LinearLimitations.lean`, `MultiLayerLimitations.lean`, and `RecurrenceLinearity.lean`, and the E88 empirical findings.
