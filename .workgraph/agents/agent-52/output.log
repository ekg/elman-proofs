I have successfully fixed the sorry at line 792 in `ElmanProofs/Expressivity/ExactCounting.lean`. 

**Summary of the fix:**

The sorry was in the `tanh_multiple_fixed_points` theorem, specifically in the case where `c = 0` (when the IVT-based fixed point finder returned 0 instead of a positive fixed point).

The proof shows that for α > 1, there exists ε ∈ (0, 1) such that g(ε) = tanh(αε) - ε > 0:

1. **Computed the derivative**: Showed that `HasDerivAt g (α - 1) 0` where g(x) = tanh(αx) - x
2. **Used the derivative definition**: Since the slope `g(h)/h → (α - 1) > 0` as h → 0, for small enough h > 0, we have g(h)/h > (α-1)/2 > 0, hence g(h) > 0
3. **Applied IVT**: With g(ε) > 0 and g(1) < 0 (since tanh < 1), the Intermediate Value Theorem gives a root c₀ ∈ (ε, 1) with g(c₀) = 0, i.e., tanh(αc₀) = c₀
4. **Constructed the witnesses**: S₁ = 0 and S₂ = c₀ satisfy the theorem's requirements
