I've successfully completed the task:

1. **Found the sorry** at line 912 in `ElmanProofs/Expressivity/ExactCounting.lean` in the `tanh_multiple_fixed_points` theorem's `c = 0` case.

2. **Wrote a real proof** using:
   - **Derivative argument**: Showed that `g(x) = tanh(αx) - x` has derivative `α - 1 > 0` at `x = 0` using `HasDerivAt` and the chain rule
   - **Limit definition**: Used `hasDerivAt_iff_tendsto_slope` and `Metric.tendsto_nhds_nhds` to extract a δ > 0 such that for `0 < x < δ`, the slope `g(x)/x > (α-1)/2 > 0`, hence `g(x) > 0`
   - **IVT application**: Combined `g(ε) > 0` (for small ε) with `g(1) < 0` (since tanh is bounded by 1) to apply `intermediate_value_Icc'` and find a root `c₀ ∈ (ε, 1)` with `tanh(α·c₀) = c₀`

3. **Verified the build** passes with `lake build` (2525 jobs completed successfully)

4. **Ran `wg done fix-tanh-multiple`** to mark the task complete
