I have completed the restyling of sections 11 and 12.

**Section 11 (Experimental Results)** was transformed from a format with colored boxes and exhaustive subsections into a flowing narrative that:
- Opens with the counterintuitive finding that Mamba2 beats E88 empirically despite lower expressivity
- Uses simple tables with `#simpletable` instead of colored `#finding` and `#observation` boxes
- Removes redundant subsection structure (11.1, 11.2.1, etc.) in favor of prose sections
- Employs `#keyinsight` for the two main takeaways
- Explains the theory-practice gap narratively rather than through bullet lists

**Section 12 (Formal System)** was condensed from an exhaustive file-by-file listing to:
- A summary of *what* is proven, not *where* it's proven
- Five core definitions capturing the main results (impossibility, separation, classification, complexity, counting)
- Single footnotes to Lean files rather than inline code blocks with line numbers
- Removal of the "How to Read Lean Code" tutorial section
- A compact verification status table
- Focus on guarantees and their limits

Both sections now use the traditional math style (no colored boxes, italicized theorems, `#leanfile` footnotes) and tell a coherent story rather than presenting disconnected facts.
