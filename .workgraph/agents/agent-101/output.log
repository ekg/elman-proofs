Task completed. I've restyled sections 1 and 2 of the expressivity document according to the traditional math style guide:

**Section 1 (Introduction):**
- Removed all colored boxes with rounded corners
- Used `#theorem`, `#keyinsight`, and `#centerrule` from the traditional style
- Wrote in flowing prose with math intermingled
- Reduced repetition (e.g., consolidated the "five claims" into a single key insight block)
- Moved Lean file references to footnotes using `#leanfile`
- Tells a coherent narrative arc from the fundamental question through historical context to what the document proves

**Section 2 (Foundations):**
- Replaced colored `#block` definitions for theorem/lemma/definition with the traditional `#theorem`, `#definition`, `#lemma`, `#corollary`, `#proposition` from the style library
- Moved all Lean code from inline blocks to footnotes using `#leanref` and `#leanfile`
- Proofs use traditional `#proof` and `#proof-sketch` environments with QED symbols
- Reduced subsection headers from numbered (2.1, 2.2...) to descriptive names
- Connected sections with narrative transitions ("The key insight is...", "This theorem explains...")
- Removed the summary table at the end (redundant with the prose)
- Added a closing `#centerrule` with the key insight restated

The document compiles successfully with typst.
