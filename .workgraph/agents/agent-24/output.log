Task `create-numericalbounds-lean` completed successfully.

**Summary of changes to `NumericalBounds.lean`:**

1. **Fixed imports** - Added `Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.ExponentialBounds` (for `exp_one_gt_d9`) and `Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Trigonometric.DerivHyp` (for `sinh_pos_iff`)

2. **Fixed `exp_3_gt_20`** - The original proof used `2.718 * 7 > 20` which is false (19.026 < 20). Fixed by computing `exp 2 > 7.38` first, then using `2.718 * 7.38 > 20`.

3. **Fixed `tanh_strictMono`** - Changed from nonexistent `div_lt_div_iff` to correct `div_lt_div_iff₀`, and fixed the final rewrite with `gt_iff_lt, Real.sinh_pos_iff`.

4. **Fixed `abs_tanh_ge_1_gt_076`** - The negative case had a rewrite pattern issue. Fixed by computing `tanh x = -tanh(-x)` directly using `Real.tanh_neg` and ring.

All proofs now compile successfully with `lake build` and contain no `sorry` placeholders.
