## Summary

I proved two continuity lemmas in `/home/erikg/elman-proofs/ElmanProofs/Expressivity/ExactCounting.lean`:

### 1. `linear_rnn_continuous_per_t` (lines 249-298)
This theorem proves that for a linear RNN, the output at any fixed position `t` is a continuous function of the full input sequence. The proof:
- Shows the truncation function is continuous (coordinate projections or constants)
- Shows `stateFromZero` is continuous by using `linear_state_is_sum` to express it as a finite sum
- Each term in the sum is a product of matrix coefficients with input components, hence continuous
- Uses composition of continuous functions: inputs → truncated → state → output

### 2. `linear_rnn_continuous_output` (lines 302-337)
This theorem proves that the full output sequence of a linear RNN is continuous in the input sequence. The proof:
- Uses `linear_state_is_sum` to express the state as a finite sum
- Shows each component of the output is a polynomial in the input coordinates
- Polynomials are continuous (finite sums of products of constants and coordinate projections)

### Helper lemma added
`continuous_matrix_mulVec` (lines 237-244): Proves that matrix-vector multiplication `M.mulVec v` is continuous in `v` for finite-dimensional matrices.
