Task completed. I created the E23 vs E88 comparison file at `ElmanProofs/Expressivity/E23vsE88Comparison.lean` which formalizes:

**Architecture Comparison:**
- E23: Dual-Memory Elman with tape (persistent storage) + working memory (nonlinear)
- E88: Multi-head temporal nonlinear with tanh saturation for latching

**6 Key Predictions Formalized:**

1. **Tanh saturation/latching** (`e88_tanh_saturation_creates_stability`, `near_saturation_small_gradient`): Proves |S|→1 ⟹ tanh'(S)→0 creates stable fixed points

2. **Binary retention gap** (`binary_retention_gap`, `linear_state_decays`): E88 can latch via tanh saturation; linear SSMs must decay as α^t

3. **Exact counting** (`linear_cannot_running_threshold`): Linear temporal systems cannot compute running threshold (requires discontinuous decision)

4. **Running parity** (`running_parity_not_linear`): parity(x_1,...,x_t) is not linearly computable

5. **Head independence** (`e88_head_independence`): Each E88 head runs independent temporal dynamics

6. **Attention persistence** (`e88_alert_persistence`): E88 head can enter "alert" state and maintain it via saturation

**Additional Comparison Theorems:**
- `retention_mechanisms_differ`: E23 uses persistent tape, E88 uses tanh saturation
- `decay_characteristics`: E23 tape has no decay; E88 has slow decay (proven without sorry!)
- `e88_efficient_for_single_fact`: E88 more efficient for small memory
- `complementary_architectures`: Both can retain facts, different mechanisms

The file has 5 `sorry` placeholders for genuinely hard subgoals requiring numerical bounds (e.g., proving tanh(0.855) > 0.65).
