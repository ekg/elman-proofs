I've completed task `write-section-08`. Here's a summary of what was created:

## Section 08: TC0 Circuit Complexity Bounds

Created `/home/erikg/elman-proofs/docs/expressivity/08-tc0-bounds.typ` covering:

### Content
1. **TC⁰ Definition** - Constant-depth threshold circuits with MAJORITY gates
2. **Transformers are TC⁰-bounded** - Citing Merrill et al. 2022
3. **Mamba2/SSMs cannot compute PARITY** - SSMs with nonnegative gates lack oscillatory dynamics
4. **E88 with unbounded T exceeds TC⁰** - Depth grows as D×T, exceeding any constant
5. **Corrected hierarchy**: Linear SSM ⊊ TC⁰ (Transformers) ⊊ E88 (unbounded T) ⊆ RE

### Key Theorems Referenced
- `TC0Bounds.lean`: `transformer_in_TC0`, `e88_exceeds_TC0_depth`
- `TC0VsUnboundedRNN.lean`: `linear_ssm_cannot_parity`, `e88_depth_unbounded`, `main_hierarchy`
- `LinearLimitations.lean`: `linear_cannot_xor`
- `ExactCounting.lean`: `e88_count_mod_3_existence`

### Main Result
The section demonstrates that the naive "Transformer > SSM > RNN" hierarchy is **reversed** for expressivity:
- E88 > Transformers > Mamba2 (for counting, parity, threshold detection)

Updated `main.typ` to include Section 08 and added TC⁰-related Lean files to the references.
