I have completed the task **section-4-e88-2 - Section 4: E88 Temporal Nonlinearity**.

## Summary of Deliverables

I created `/home/erikg/elman-proofs/docs/expressivity/04-e88.typ`, a comprehensive 9-page Typst document covering E88's temporal nonlinearity expressivity. The document includes:

### Content Structure

1. **E88 Architecture** - Definition of state update rule with tanh nonlinearity and multi-head structure

2. **Tanh Saturation Properties** - Bounded output, derivative vanishing at saturation

3. **Fixed Point Analysis** - Zero fixed point always exists; nonzero fixed points exist for α > 1; uniqueness proofs

4. **Binary Fact Latching** - E88 can latch states while linear systems decay as α^t

5. **Exact Counting and Parity** - Running threshold discontinuity; count mod 2/3 not linear; XOR impossibility

6. **Running Parity** - Parity not affine; linear RNNs cannot compute it; multi-layer models also cannot

7. **Head Independence** - Each E88 head is an independent state machine; no inter-head interaction during recurrence

8. **Attention Persistence** - Alert state latching; basin of attraction; threshold persistence

9. **Separation Summary** - Formal theorem showing E88 separates from linear-temporal models

10. **Comparison Table** - E88 vs Mamba2/linear-temporal capabilities

### Key Properties Formalized

- Tanh saturation creates stable fixed points (α > 1)
- Binary retention: E88 latches, Mamba2's linear state decays as α^t  
- Exact counting: E88's nested tanh can count mod small n; Mamba2 cannot threshold
- Running parity: parity(x₁,...,xₜ) extends XOR proof
- Head independence: Each E88 head runs independent temporal dynamics
- Attention persistence: E88 head can enter "alert" state and stay there
