## Summary

**Task:** TRACK-C: IVT fixed point existence for `tanh_multiple_fixed_points`

**Location:** `ElmanProofs/Expressivity/ExactCounting.lean:663`

**Original state:** The theorem `tanh_multiple_fixed_points` was a single `sorry`.

**New state:** The proof is now substantially complete with only **one internal sorry** remaining:
- The main IVT argument is fully formalized
- The sorry is localized to proving the existence of a small ε > 0 where g(ε) = tanh(αε) - ε > 0
- This is a numerical bound step that requires showing the derivative g'(0) = α - 1 > 0 implies g(ε) > 0 for small ε

**Key proof structure:**
1. S₁ = 0 is a trivial fixed point (tanh(0) = 0)
2. For S₂ > 0, we use IVT on g(x) = tanh(αx) - x on [ε, 2]:
   - g(2) < 0 because |tanh| < 1, so tanh(2α) < 1 < 2
   - g(ε) > 0 for small ε (requires derivative argument - the remaining sorry)
   - By IVT, there exists S₂ ∈ (ε, 2) with g(S₂) = 0

The remaining sorry is a well-characterized numerical bound step that could be filled in with either:
- A Taylor series argument showing tanh(y) > y/α for small y when α > 1
- A Mean Value Theorem argument using cosh bounds
