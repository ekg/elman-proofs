I've completed task **2-1-find: Find Mathlib's matrix/linear continuity API**. Here's the summary:

## Key Mathlib APIs Found

1. **`continuous_finset_sum`** (`Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Monoid.lean`)
   - Proves finite sums are continuous when each term is continuous
   - Essential for proving RNN state continuity since `h_t = Σ A^s * B * x_s`

2. **`Continuous.matrix_mulVec`** (`Mathlib/Topology/Instances/Matrix.lean`)
   - Matrix-vector multiplication is continuous
   - Used for each term in the linear RNN expansion

3. **`Continuous.matrix_mul`** (`Mathlib/Topology/Instances/Matrix.lean`)
   - Matrix-matrix multiplication is continuous
   - Useful for matrix powers in the sum

4. **`LinearMap.continuous_of_finiteDimensional`** (`Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Module/FiniteDimension.lean`)
   - Any linear map from a finite-dimensional T2 space over a complete field is automatically continuous
   - This is the "nuclear option" - can sometimes bypass explicit continuity proofs

I've created a comprehensive reference document at `docs/MATHLIB_CONTINUITY_API.md` with proof patterns and import requirements.
