I've completed the iteration-4-fix task for ExactCounting.lean. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

**Started with:** 15 sorries (as stated in the task, though I counted 14 initially)

**Ended with:** 11 sorries

**Proofs completed:**
1. **`running_threshold_discontinuous`** - Proved using connected space topology: a continuous function on a connected space (Fin T → ℝ) that only takes values in {0, 1} cannot achieve both values unless constant. Used `IsConnected.isPreconnected.ordConnected` to show the range must be an interval.

2. **`kOnesInput_count`** - Proved using bijection with Fin k to count elements satisfying the filter predicate.

3. **`linear_cannot_running_threshold`** - Proved by showing if a linear RNN computed the threshold function, it would be continuous (via `linear_rnn_continuous_output`), contradicting `running_threshold_discontinuous`.

**Sorries remaining (with explanations):**
- `linear_rnn_continuous_per_t` / `linear_rnn_continuous_output` - Need continuity machinery for matrix operations
- `exact_count_detection_not_linear` - Similar discontinuity argument to running threshold
- `count_mod_2_not_linear` / `count_mod_3_not_linear` - XOR impossibility argument (affine linearity violation)
- `e88_count_mod_2` / `e88_count_mod_3_existence` - Need specific numerical parameter construction
- `tanh_multiple_fixed_points` - Needs IVT for fixed point existence
- `tanh_basin_of_attraction` - Needs contraction mapping argument
- `e88_threshold_count` / `latched_threshold_persists` - Need numerical bounds on tanh

The remaining sorries are primarily blocked by:
1. Numerical computation (tanh bounds like tanh(0.9) > 0.71)
2. IVT-based existence proofs in Lean
3. Complex case analysis for XOR-like arguments
