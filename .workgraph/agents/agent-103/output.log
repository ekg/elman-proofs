I've restyled sections 5 and 6. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Section 5 (E23 vs E88):**
- Imported traditional-math-style.typ
- Removed all colored boxes, replaced with proper theorem/definition/lemma environments
- Added narrative transitions connecting to the overall story
- Used `keyinsight` blocks for the two key philosophical points
- Converted the comparison tables to `simpletable` with minimal styling
- Added proper Lean footnote references with `leanfile()`
- Made the prose more flowing and less "bullet-point" style
- Reduced repetition between the mechanisms section and later content

**Section 6 (Separation Results):**
- Imported traditional-math-style.typ and removed all colored boxes
- Consolidated the hierarchy into a single **Main Theorem** at the start
- Organized separating witnesses into one clear table
- Grouped the impossibility results under two barriers: "Affine Barrier" and "Continuity Barrier"
- Reduced redundancy by stating XOR impossibility once and deriving parity as a corollary
- Added a proof-sketch for E88's parity computation
- Used a single summary table instead of multiple verbose theorem blocks
- Added a remark clarifying these are mathematical theorems, not empirical observations
- Cut overall length while preserving all essential content
