I have completed the task. Here's a summary of what was delivered:

## Deep Introduction Written

The new introduction (`docs/expressivity/01-introduction.typ`) provides comprehensive context across all six requested elements:

### 1. The Fundamental Question: Where Should Nonlinearity Be Placed?
- Frames the core design choice: between tokens (Transformers), between layers (Mamba2/FLA/GDN), or through time (E88/RNNs)
- Establishes that this choice determines computational capabilities

### 2. Historical Context: Transformers vs RNNs vs SSMs
- RNN Era (1990s-2017): Rich temporal dynamics but training difficulties
- Transformer Revolution (2017-2022): Removed sequential dependencies, enabled parallelism
- SSM Resurgence (2022-present): Linear recurrence for efficiency
- E88 Alternative (2025): Hardware-friendly temporal nonlinearity

### 3. Key Insight: Temporal vs Depth-wise Nonlinearity
- The central quote: "Nonlinearity flows down (through layers), not forward (through time)"
- Composition depth comparison: Linear-temporal = $D$, Nonlinear-temporal = $D \times T$
- Clear table comparing Mamba2, E88, and Transformers

### 4. TC⁰ Circuit Complexity Framing
- Connects architecture limitations to computational complexity theory
- Explains why parity is outside TC⁰ and why this matters
- Shows linear-temporal models are bounded by TC⁰ while E88 escapes it

### 5. Emergent Computation: Output Feedback Creates Tape Memory
- Chain-of-thought as emergent working memory
- The complete hierarchy: Fixed Mamba2 ⊊ Fixed E88 ⊊ E88+Feedback ≅ Transformer+CoT ⊊ E23 (UTM)
- Explains why CoT dramatically improves reasoning

### 6. Detailed Roadmap of All Sections
- Section-by-section breakdown of what each proves
- Specific Lean file and line number references
- Three-phase structure: Limitations → Separation → Practical Synthesis
- Reading guide for different audiences (practitioners, theorists, curious readers)

The introduction is approximately 4x longer than the original and provides the deep mathematical and historical context needed to understand the document's significance.
