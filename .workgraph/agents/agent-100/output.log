Task completed. I've created a traditional math style file for Typst at `docs/expressivity/traditional-math-style.typ`.

**Summary of the style file:**

The style provides traditional LaTeX-style theorem environments with:

1. **No colored boxes** - Uses simple block spacing and optional horizontal rules instead of rounded colored boxes
2. **Italic theorem statements** - Theorems, lemmas, corollaries, propositions have italic body text (traditional math style)
3. **Proper proof formatting** - *Proof.* in italic followed by body and filled QED square ($\blacksquare$); also `#proof-sketch` with hollow square
4. **Sans-serif font maintained** - Compatible with DejaVu Sans as set in main.typ
5. **Lean references as footnotes** - `#leanref("File.lean:42", "theorem name")` creates a footnote instead of inline code blocks
6. **Visual elements** - Horizontal rules (`#lightrule`, `#mediumrule`, `#heavyrule`), `#keyinsight` for emphasized quotes

**Usage:**
```typst
#import "traditional-math-style.typ": *
#show: setup-traditional-style

#theorem("State as Weighted Sum")[
  For a linear RNN starting from $h_0 = 0$, the state at time $T$ is $h_T = sum_(t=0)^(T-1) A^(T-1-t) B x_t$.
]#leanref("LinearCapacity.lean:72", "theorem linear_state_is_sum")

#proof[
  By induction on $T$. The base case follows from $h_0 = 0$.
