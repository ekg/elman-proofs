The task is complete. The `linear_rnn_continuous_per_t` theorem was already fully proven in ExactCounting.lean (lines 249-302). The proof demonstrates that for a linear RNN, the output at any fixed position t is a continuous function of the full input sequence by:

1. Showing the truncation function is continuous (each coordinate is either a projection or constant)
2. Showing `stateFromZero` is continuous via `linear_state_is_sum`, expressing it as a finite sum of continuous matrix/input terms
3. Showing `C.mulVec` is continuous using `continuous_matrix_mulVec`
4. Composing these continuous functions
